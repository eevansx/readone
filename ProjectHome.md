[CHM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_help) is a poular format for e-books but its not natively supported on many non-windows devices.

This tool was written to convert CHM to formats like plain text, [RTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format), [PDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format), [DOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word),
[HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and perhaps more. Converting to RTF or PDF makes it a lot easier to view and print these files.

**Requirements** :
  * Windows operating system (Support for other OS depends on interest)
  * [.NET framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) (2.0 or higher). [Install from Microsoft's website](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en). You can skip this step, installer will prompt you to download and install .NET
  * Microsoft Office (I haven't tested with lesser than 2003, perhaps someday!). Openoffice is also an option.

**Status** :
  * [See updates](http://code.google.com/p/readone/wiki/Status)

**Install** :
  * Download and unzip
  * Run setup.exe

**Usage** :
  * Select a CHM file
  * Select output format (currently rtf, doc, html, txt). Pdf support will be added later.

  * Set a book title & destination folder
  * Press "Convert" button !

**Uninstall**
  * Go to Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs
